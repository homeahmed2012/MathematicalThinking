- Mathematics is the Science of pattern and there are many types of patterns around us.
- Mathematics regarding the Patterns
- Geometry -> studying the Patterns of shapes
- Topology -> positions and closings 
- and calculus -> motions patterns
- it's the language of the nature!

also the proff talked a bit about the historical background
- 10000 years ago the humans started math in the to deal with money
- the ancient Egyptian and the Babylonians included Geometry and Trigonometry to mathematics   
- the Greeks 500 BCE made it into the era of study not just collection of techniques and procedures 
- Arabs has developed Algebra in the eighth and ninth centuries ( يقصد الخوارزمى على ما اعتقد ) 
- 19th century was Math revolution which took place in Germany
they started to make it abstract and focusing more on analyzing the relationships of the concepts not just using the procedures and the calculations

then he started talking about the Language of Mathematics
- you have to be precise and avoid any kind of ambiguity.
- in Math we don't rely on Context and Background Knowledge but it's Highly *restricted*  language.

the common forms of the language are
1) the object a has property p  --> example     3 is a prime number
2) all elements of object T has property p         --> example .. all polynomial equation has a complex root.
3) there is object a has prop  p --> there is prime number between 20 and 25
4) if statement a then statement b.-->  if a prime number is in the form 4n+1 then it's a sum of squares
then he talked about the Math Logic and said that the Greeks putted those Math functions
AND , OR , NOT, Implies , Equivalence ,For All , There Exists

the *second* lecture was about And , Or , Not and solved some problems using them
