# Quiz 1  <Introduction to Mathematical thinking>
```
1) Is it possible for one of (ϕ∧ψ)∧θ and ϕ∧(ψ∧θ) to be true and the other false? (If not, then the associative property holds for conjunction.)
> answer : [no].   --> obviously the associative property holds of the Conjunction. and you can make sure also by trial. 
```

```
2) Is it possible for one of (ϕ∨ψ)∨θ and ϕ∨(ψ∨θ) to be true and the other false? (If not, then the associative property holds for disjunction.)
answer : [no]
````
````
3) Is it possible for one of ϕ∧(ψ∨θ) and (ϕ∧ψ)∨(ϕ∧θ) to be true and the other false? (If not, then the distributive property holds for conjunction across disjunction.) 
> answer : [no]

```
4) Is it possible for one of ϕ∨(ψ∧θ) and (ϕ∨ψ)∧(ϕ∨θ) to be true and the other false? (If not, then the distributive property holds for disjunction across conjunction.) 
> answer : [no]
```
```
5) Is showing that the negation ¬ϕ is true equivalent to showing that ϕ is false?
> answer : YES     --> ¬(true) = false.

6) Assuming you know nothing more about Alice, which of (a) - (e) is most likely? (Or does (f) hold?) 
> answer : (e) Alice works in a bank.  --> check the Proffessor Video Note.
```
```
7) Assuming you know nothing more about Alice, which of (a) - (e) is most likely? (Or does (f) hold?)
> answer : (a) Alice is a rock star or she works in a bank.
since it's a disjuction so it's either one of the answers.

8) Identify which of the following are true (where x denotes an arbitrary real number). If you do not select a particular statement,
the system will assume you think it is false.
(x>0)∧(x≤10) means 0≤x≤10   --> FASLE

(x≥0)∧(x2<9) means 0≤x<3     --> TRUE

(x≥0)∧(x≤0) means x=0  ---> TRUE

There is no x for which (x<4)∧(x>4) --> TRUE

−5≤x≤5 means x is at most 5 units from 0.   --> TRUE

−5<x<5 implies that x cannot be exactly 5 units from 0.  --> TRUE

(x≥0)∨(x<0)  --> TRUE

(0=1)∨(x2≥0)    --> TRUE

If (x>0∨x<0) then x≠0.   --> TRUE

If x2=9 then (x=3∨x=−3).   --> TRUE
