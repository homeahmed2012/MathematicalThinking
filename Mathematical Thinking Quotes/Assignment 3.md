# Introduction to Mathematical Thinking ASSIGNMENT 3

1. Let D be the statement “The dollar is strong”, Y the statement “The Yuan is strong” and T
the statement “New US–China trade agreement signed”. Express the main content of each of the
following (fictitious) newspaper headlines in logical notation. (Remember, logical notation captures
truth, but not the many nuances and inferences of natural language.) As before, make sure you
could justify and defend your answers.
(a) New trade agreement **_will lead_** to strong currencies in both countries.<br />
> **T  ⇒ Y^D**
(b) Strong Dollar means a weak Yuan <br />
> **D ⇒ ¬Y**
( c)Trade agreement fails on news of weak Dollar. <br />
> ** ¬D  ⇒ ¬Y**
(d) If new trade agreement is signed, Dollar and Yuan can’t both remain strong  <br />
> **T  ⇒¬ (Y^D).**
(e) Dollar weak but Yuan strong, following new trade agreement. <br />
> **(¬D ^ Y)  ⇒ T**
(f) If the trade agreement is signed, a rise in the Yuan will result in a fall in the Dollar. <br />
> **Y^T  ⇒ ¬D**  or **  T    ⇒¬[Y    ⇒ ¬D]** 
(g) New trade agreement means Dollar and Yuan will rise and fall together. <br />
> **T -->  (Y^D)v¬(Y^D).**
(h) New trade agreement will be good for one side, but no one knows which.  <br />
> **T  ⇒ (D ^¬Y)v(¬D ^Y)** 
<br />
2. Complete the following truth table

|`¬φ` |` ¬φ` | `ψ `| `φ ⇒ ψ` | `¬φ ∨ ψ `|
|----|----|---|-------|--------|
| T  | **F**  | T | **T**     | **T**      |
| T  | **F**  | F | **F**     | **F**      |
| F  | **T**  | T | **T**     | **T**      |
| F  | **T**  | F | **T**     | **T**      |

Note: ¬ has the same binding rules as − (minus) in arithmetic and algebra, so ¬φ ∨ ψ is the same
as (¬φ) ∨ ψ.
3. What conclusions can you draw from the above table?
> the 3rd ,4th Columns are equivalent.
4. Complete the following truth table. (Recall that φ 6⇒ ψ is another way of writing ¬[φ ⇒ ψ].)

| `φ `|` ψ` |` ¬ψ` |` φ ⇒ ψ `|` ¬(φ ⇒ ψ )`| `φ ∧ ¬ψ `|
|:-:|:-:|:--:|:-----:|:------:|:------:|
| **T** | **T** |  F |   T   |    F   |    F   |
| **T** |**F**|  T |   F   |    T   |    T   |
| **F** | **T** |  F |   T   |    F   |    T   |
| **F** | **F** |  T |   T   |    F   |    T   |

5. What conclusions can you draw from the above table?
> 4th and 5th are equilvalent

# PUZZLE
A woman was driving in her car along a black road. She did not have her car lights on. There was no Moon and no light from the stars. A black dog was asleep in the middle of the road. As the woman approached the dog, she swerved to avoid it, and the animal slept on. How did the woman know to swerve around the dog? 
> I think that he didn't mention the time so it might be related to the time.
> them woman is driving in a daytime! :D
